# BuddoLuciferianism
BuddoLuciferianism combines the serene enlightenment of Buddhism, promoting inner peace and mindfulness, with the rebellious spirit of Lucifer, symbolizing the quest for personal freedom and the courage to challenge authority. This philosophy harmonizes spiritual tranquility with transformative change and the pursuit of individual empowerment.
